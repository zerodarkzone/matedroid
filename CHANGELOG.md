# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Custom HTTP headers**: A new "Custom HTTP Headers" section in Advanced Network Settings lets you define arbitrary key-value header pairs that are sent with every API request. Useful for authenticating through reverse proxies or gateways that require headers like `X-API-Key` or `CF-Access-Client-Id`.

### Security
- **Encrypted credential storage**: API token, Basic Auth username/password, and custom header values are now stored in `EncryptedSharedPreferences` backed by the Android Keystore hardware enclave, instead of plain DataStore. Existing credentials are migrated automatically and silently on the first launch after update.

## [1.9.0-beta1] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- **Menu in the top-right**: the dashboard's lone Settings gear is now a menu with Stats for nerds, Battery health, Where was I?, Sentry events and Settings.
- **Create a trip by hand**: a + button on the Trips list lets you build a road-trip manually — pick the day, then choose the drives and charges that belong to it (handy when auto-detection misses one).

### Changed
- **Redesigned the bottom Activity card**: Trips now headlines the card as a tall tile with the trip count and a peek at your latest road-trip; Mileage and Charges sit alongside it, with Drives and Software below. "Where was I?" moved out of the Location card into the new menu.
- **Redesigned the Location card** into an immersive, full-bleed map (muted to match light/dark theme) with the place name and details over it; tap anywhere to open it in your maps app.
- **Tyre pressure moved into its own card** with a cleaner 2×2 grid — one tile per wheel with its pressure and an OK/low status dot.
- **The empty Trips screen now explains itself**: when no road-trips have been detected, it lists how one is auto-generated (2+ drives in a row, linked by a DC fast-charge stop, totalling 300 km or more).

### Fixed
- **Scroll thumb no longer jumps to the end** on the Trips, Drives and Charges lists — it now tracks the real scroll position the whole way down (the old mapping capped it near 80% and snapped to the bottom), and on the Trips list it stays clear of the new + button.
- **Software updates list showed each version's "days installed" off by one** — a version displayed the duration that actually belonged to the previous one. Each version now shows how long it was installed before the next update.

## [1.8.1] - 2026-06-07

### Fixed
- **Trip total duration no longer wraps onto multiple lines** under the timeline on the trip detail screen, regardless of screen size or the device's font-size setting.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-06-06

German language support, a redesigned "Where was I?" screen, and a round of localization and reliability fixes.

### Added
- **German translation (Deutsch)**: the app is now fully available in German.

### Changed
- **"Where was I?" redesign**: the Location and State cards are merged into a single "what + where" card with a state-aware headline ("Heading to Home" / "Charging at..." / "Parked at..."). The map is fully interactive (single-finger drag to pan, pinch to zoom) and a new "Open in Maps" button opens the spot in your maps app.

### Fixed
- **Locale-aware dates, times and durations**: these now follow your device language instead of fixed English/numeric patterns (e.g. durations read "10小时48分钟" in Chinese), and clock times honor your system's 12/24-hour setting.
- **"Drives" and "Trips" no longer share the same word** in Spanish, Catalan, Italian and Chinese, where both used to translate identically. Drives now use a distinct term (es "Trayectos", ca "Trajectes", it "Tragitti", zh "行程").
- **Maps stopped fighting the page scroll**: dragging the map on the trip, drive and charge detail screens now pans/zooms the map instead of scrolling the page.
- **Black Diamond Black cars showed as white**: the "DiamondBlack" paint wasn't recognized and fell back to white. It now renders correctly.
- **Stuck on a car that can't load**: if the selected car's data failed to load (e.g. a car removed from your account that TeslaMate still lists), the dashboard got stuck with no way out. The car selector now stays available so you can switch to a working car.
- **Trips list shows energy consumed, not energy charged.**
- **"Today" filter now respects your timezone** instead of using UTC, so it shows the right day's drives and charges.

## [1.8.0-beta3] - 2026-06-06

### Fixed
- **Long navigation labels no longer wrap on the dashboard**: localized words like the Spanish "Trayectos" or Catalan "Trajectes" overflowed the Drives/Charges/Trips buttons onto a second line. The label now shrinks slightly to stay on one line; labels that already fit are unchanged.

## [1.8.0-beta2] - 2026-06-06

### Added
- **German translation** — the app is now fully available in German (Deutsch). Thanks to @herrfrei for the contribution.

### Fixed
- **Stuck on a car whose data can't load**: if the selected car's status failed to load (e.g. a car removed from your Tesla account that TeslaMate still lists), the dashboard got stuck and the car selector disappeared, so you couldn't switch to a working car. The car selector now stays visible with an inline error + Retry, and switching cars clears the error (#272).
- **Black Juniper Model Y (and Highland Model 3) showed a white car**: the "Diamond Black" paint is reported by TeslaMate as `DiamondBlack`, which wasn't recognized, so the car image fell back to white. It now renders in black.
- **"Drives" and "Trips" no longer share the same word** in Spanish, Catalan, Italian, and Chinese, where both were translated identically (e.g. both "Viajes") — making the navigation and stats ambiguous now that Trips exist. Drives now use a distinct term (es "Trayectos", ca "Trajectes", it "Tragitti", zh "行程") while Trips keep the journey word.

## [1.8.0-beta1] - 2026-05-31

### Changed
- **"Where was I?" screen redesign**: the separate Location and State cards are merged into a single "what + where" card, with a state-aware sentence on top — "Heading to Home" / "Charging at Tesla SC" / "Parked at Home" — that makes the relationship between the activity and the named place unambiguous (no more bare "Home" appearing during a drive headed home). The map is now fully interactive — single-finger drag pans, pinch zooms — and a new "Open in Maps" button overlay on the map opens the location in your external maps app. The chevron that opens the related drive/charge moved to the top-right of the merged card, vertically aligned with the title.

### Fixed
- **Maps in scrollable screens no longer fight the page scroll**: dragging the map on the trip, drive, and charge detail screens panned the page instead of the map (vertical drags in particular got hijacked by the surrounding scroll). The map now claims the gesture as soon as your finger lands on it, so single-finger drag pans and pinch zooms behave the same as on the "Where was I?" map (#284).
- **Locale-aware date, time, and duration formatting**: dates, times, and durations across the app now follow your device's locale instead of fixed English/numeric patterns. Durations read as `10小时48分钟` in Chinese (and localized abbreviations in Italian, Spanish and Catalan) rather than `10h 48m`; chart axis labels, the charge/drive history datelines, and week labels (`第23周`) use locale-appropriate month/day order and names; and clock times now honor your system's 12-/24-hour setting. All formatting is consolidated in one utility so it stays consistent. Thanks to @HEXDude for the original contribution (#279, #280).
- **Trips list now shows energy consumed, not energy charged**: the per-trip `kWh` value in the trips list was the energy added at charging stops, shown without a label, which read as the trip's total consumption. It now shows the actual electricity consumed while driving — and appears even on trips with no charging stops (#281).
- **"Today" filter showed the wrong day's drives/charges outside UTC**: date filters were sent to the API as UTC midnight (`...T00:00:00Z`) regardless of your timezone, so the "today" window was shifted by your UTC offset — pulling in the previous day's activity for users behind UTC (e.g. the Americas) and dropping early-morning activity for users ahead of it (e.g. Europe). Filters now use your device's local timezone offset, computed per boundary so DST days are correct. Same fix applied to the "Where was I?" date window.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-04-30

Complete visual refresh of the **drives and charges lists**, plus a new fast-scroll bar and several smaller fixes.

### Changed
- **Drives & charges list redesign**: Both lists swap their 4-stat-card rows for a magazine-style editorial layout — a 4 dp accent edge (gold for drives, green for AC, orange for DC), an ALL-CAPS dateline above the route or location, supporting numbers reduced to small pills (duration, max speed, battery delta, cost), and the headline metric (km / kWh) set as a display-weight hero on the right. Rows are noticeably shorter so more fits on screen, and the visual language now matches the trips list. Free charges show a green "FREE" pill; when TeslaMate cost-editing is available, the cost pill becomes tappable and gains a small ↗ glyph. Drive durations now use the cascading-unit format (`47m`, `2h 14m`) instead of `0:47` / `2:14`.
- Mileage screen perf improvements.

### Added
- **Draggable month scrollbar**: drives, charges and trips lists now show a small thumb on the right edge whenever the list is long enough to need it (≥20 items and actually scrollable). Drag the thumb vertically for fast scroll; while dragging, a floating label pill peeks out to the left of your finger showing the date of the row under the thumb. Format auto-adapts to the list's date range — `25 APR` for short ranges (≤2 months), `APR '26` once it spans more. Thumb fades after a moment of inactivity. Locale-aware month names in all 5 supported languages.
- **Branded loading spinner**: the MD logotype, drawn dim with a brighter accent dot tracing its outline forward and back, replaces the generic spinner across long loads (initial loads on every screen, plus a dim-scrim overlay on the drives/charges lists when switching date filters). Debounced 200 ms so cached/snappy loads never flash a spinner.

### Fixed
- **Filters reset after backgrounding the app** — Date range, charge type, cost, and location selections on the charges list, and date range and distance-bucket on the drives list, are now persisted across process death. Coming back to either list restores the filters you had set.
- **"Where was I?" returned "Invalid date"** for any date with a non-UTC timezone offset — the timestamp was URL-decoded twice on the way to the screen, mangling the `+02:00` (or similar) part of the offset into a literal space and breaking parsing. Single-decode now.
- **Charges list hero unit was rendered as `KWH`** — SI symbols are case-sensitive, so the unit now correctly reads `kWh`.

## [1.7.0-beta1] - 2026-04-28

- **Charges list hero unit was rendered as `KWH`** — SI symbols are case-sensitive, so the unit now correctly reads `kWh`. Distance units on the drives list still render uppercase to keep the editorial all-caps look.

### Changed
- Mileage screen perf improvements.
- **Drives & charges list redesign**: Both lists swap their 4-stat-card rows for a magazine-style editorial layout — a 4 dp accent edge (gold for drives, green for AC, orange for DC), an ALL-CAPS dateline above the route or location, supporting numbers reduced to small pills (duration, max speed, battery delta, cost), and the headline metric (km / kWh) set as a display-weight hero on the right. Rows are noticeably shorter so more fits on screen, and the visual language now matches the trips list. Free charges show a green "FREE" pill; when TeslaMate cost-editing is available, the cost pill becomes tappable and gains a small ↗ glyph — replacing the old trailing open-in-new icon. Drive durations now use the cascading-unit format (`47m`, `2h 14m`) instead of `0:47` / `2:14`, matching the trips list.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-04-25

This release is a top-to-bottom rebuild of the **Trips experience**, plus a handful of refinements elsewhere.

### Added
- **Trips list redesign**: Trip rows are now about 60% of their previous height and carry a subtle 6dp timeline "fingerprint" strip beneath the route — a compressed version of the detail screen's timeline so different trips (multi-day with DC + AC overnight, daily commute with a parking gap, a single short drive) are visually distinguishable before you read any text. Date chip + route + distance up top, fingerprint middle, duration · stops · kWh meta below. Date chip includes a 2-digit year (`21 APR 26`); durations cascade units so long trips no longer show raw hours (`2d 3h`, `1w 2d`, `1mo 2w`).
- **Trip detail timeline**: Horizontal timeline bar on the trip detail screen, under the map, visualizing each drive, charge, and parking gap as a colored segment proportional to its duration. Drives use the car's accent color, charges use the established AC/DC palette (green/orange, harmonized with the car's theme), parking gaps use a muted neutral. Tap any segment to see its details; multi-day parking stretches are compressed with a sqrt curve so driving and charging stay readable. A small white icon appears on the first segment of each kind (steering wheel for drives, bolt for DC, plug for AC, P for parking) so the color legend is self-explanatory. Below the bar: driving / charging / total durations centered between the start and end clock times.
- **Edit trips**: Two new buttons below the trip legs — "Add leg" and "Merge trip". "Add leg" opens a bottom sheet listing drives and charges within ±2 days of the trip that aren't already in another saved trip. "Merge trip" opens a bottom sheet listing adjacent trips within ±14 days and, after confirmation, combines them into one trip — automatically rolling in all drives and charges (AC included) between them. Dashed line on the map connects legs that are geographically far apart (e.g., when the car was transported). Delete a trip via the top-bar overflow menu: the underlying auto-detected trips reappear automatically, which is the built-in way to undo a merge or edit.
- **Trip cost donut**: New breakdown of charging costs on the trip detail. Each charge stop becomes a donut segment sized by its share of the total, with DC and AC stops getting distinct lightness shades of their palette color so individual charges are visually distinguishable within their type. Total cost sits in the center; tap a segment to pop it outward and swap the center for that stop's city + AC/DC chip + cost + kWh + duration. Expand the card to reveal the avg-cost-per-100 km/mi and per-kWh pills plus a per-charge list tinted with matching segment shades.
- **Horizontal battery energy-flow card**: The old battery stats grid is replaced by a horizontal Sankey-style flow. A battery pictogram (body + tip) in the middle shows total kWh charged. Two inflow streams on the left — DC on top and AC below — start very thin at the source, stay flat for 80% of their run, then expand via cubic bezier to their proportional share of battery height over the last 20%. One outflow on the right has the inverse profile: full battery height, tapering to thin. Gradients fade out near the battery and in towards the outer ends, reinforcing the flow direction. Labels: per-inflow kWh + avg kW, per-outflow kWh + Wh/km (or Wh/mi).
- **Weather during the trip**: New temperature sparkline card — temperature over time with weather condition icons floating on the line at each sample. Samples are drawn from the trip's driving GPS points, ~1 per hour of drive time (clamped between 3 and 12), and fetched in parallel from Open-Meteo. Fahrenheit honored when the units setting is imperial. Card hides itself if the trip is too recent for Open-Meteo's archive (2–5 day delay).
- **Trip legs count in header**: The "Trip legs" card now shows the composition summary inline — `3 🚘 + 2 ⚡` — and is collapsible, mirroring the cost card UX. Drive and Charge leg cards also dropped their redundant "Drive N" / "Charge N" labels; icon + city + distance/kWh already conveys it.
- **Trip persistence**: Trips are now stored as first-class database entities. Auto-detected trips are silently persisted on first detection, unlocking the ability to edit and merge trips. Existing trip history is unaffected.
- **Trip map overlays**: Date range (top-left) and total distance (bottom-right) now render as translucent accent-color chips directly on the trip map.
- **Cost filter on the charges list**: a new `Cost` dropdown sits next to `Type` and `Location` (the filter row was reshuffled into three single-select dropdowns: ⚡ Type, 💰 Cost, 📍 Location). Pick `No cost` to isolate sessions where no price has been recorded — most useful for cleaning up DC charges where TeslaMate doesn't pull a cost automatically. From there, the existing "edit on TeslaMate" trailing icon gets you to the right place. For cars with Free Supercharging enabled in TeslaMate's car settings, picking `No cost` surfaces a one-line hint clarifying that Supercharger sessions are legitimately free, so the filter is most useful for non-Supercharger DC stops.

### Changed
- **Trip detail**: Add leg / Merge trip actions moved to sit directly under the trip legs card and above the weather card.
- **Trip detail performance**: On-resume revalidation is non-destructive — back-nav no longer blanks the screen to a spinner, so the map keeps its tiles and polyline, the donut doesn't re-animate, and the timeline doesn't rebuild. `@Immutable` annotations on hot-path models let Compose skip recomposition when values are structurally equal. Map overlay preparation runs on `Dispatchers.Default`. MapView mount is deferred a frame to keep scroll responsive after back-nav.
- **Charts for weeks and months**: "Last 90 days" and "Last year" filters on charges / drives / trips charts now render every week / every month in the range, including empty ones, so gaps of inactivity are visible in the trend line. Week labels include the year (`W52'25`, `W1'26`) to avoid duplicates across year boundaries.
- **Trips list summary card**: total distance and total energy charged lost their decimals; total driving time uses the new cascading-unit format too.
- Internal dependency bumps (AGP 9.1 / Kotlin 2.3 / Hilt 2.59 / WorkManager 2.10 / OkHttp 5 / Retrofit 3).

### Fixed
- **DatePicker timezone off-by-one**: "Where was I that day?" on the dashboard could pick the previous day in some time zones because `DatePicker.selectedDateMillis` (UTC midnight) was being reinterpreted via `ZoneId.systemDefault()`. The extraction is now UTC-anchored and the system zone is applied only at the final timestamp composition, so the picked date matches what the user tapped in every zone.
- **Charges / Drives list flashed on date-filter change when a secondary filter was active**: the 1.3.x spinner-flicker guard only kicked in if the currently-displayed list was non-empty, so toggling the date range while AC/DC or distance filters had zeroed out the visible list made the screen swap to a full-screen spinner during the refetch. The guard now checks the raw unfiltered load instead, so the spinner only appears on the true initial load and filter transitions stay smooth.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- **DC unplug warning mis-firing on AC**: The warning to unplug after a DC session was also showing after AC sessions completed while plugged in. TeslaMate reports `charger_phases=null` after any session, so the old heuristic "null phases = DC" misclassified AC completions. The DC session type is now persisted while the session is active and reused after completion.
- **Sentry ES translation**: Fixed a typo in the Spanish localization of the Sentry alert strings.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- **HTTP Basic Auth**: Support for HTTP Basic Authentication in the Advanced network settings, for servers behind a reverse proxy requiring credentials. Enables compatibility with MyTeslaMate and other setups using authenticated reverse proxies.
- **Custom date range filter**: Drives, charges, and trips pages now have a "Custom" filter chip that opens two date pickers (from/to). The chip label shows the selected range in locale-aware DD/MM or MM/DD format.
- **Charging elapsed timer in status bar**: Live chronometer displayed next to the notification icon in the Android status bar during active charging sessions (MM:SS, then H:MM:SS after 1 hour).
- **DC unplug warning**: When a DC charge completes but the cable remains plugged in, the notification icon switches to a warning variant with a chronometer counting time since completion. The live charge screen shows an orange warning banner prompting the user to unplug and free the DC spot. AC charges continue to dismiss the notification as before.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- **Sentry alert addresses**: Fixed empty geofence string from the API causing blank address display instead of showing the reverse-geocoded location or "Alert detected" fallback.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **Trip grouping**: Automatically detects highway/road trips (drives connected by DC charging stops) and groups them into unified trips. Dedicated Trips screen with list and detail view including route map, country flags, summary stats, and per-leg breakdown.
- **Sentry alert history**: Persistent on-device log of sentry alert events with 6-day activity heatmap and location-aware alerts showing geofence name or address. Tap the red sentry dot on the dashboard or widget to view current session and past alerts.
- **Widget charging power**: Home screen widget now shows charging power in the status bar icons.
- **Mileage screen**: Added energy cost, total energy consumption, and average efficiency (Wh/km) to all levels (lifetime, year, month, day).
- **Charges screen**: "Select all / Deselect all" toggle in the location filter dropdown, respects the current search query.

### Changed
- **Trip detail map**: Map tiles now load in parallel with route data for faster display. Route points are simplified with Douglas-Peucker for smoother rendering.
- **Trip route caching**: GPS route data and country sequence are cached in Room for instant reload on subsequent views.
- **Chart Y-axis**: Labels now show meaningful, non-repeating values with automatic decimal precision. Battery charts auto-fit to actual data range instead of fixed 0-100%.
- **OSMDroid tile cache**: Centralized tile cache configuration across all map screens.

### Fixed
- **Temperature charts**: Removed double-conversion on charge detail temperature chart (values already pre-converted by API).
- **Weather Along the Way**: Fixed missing °C→°F conversion for Open-Meteo weather data when using imperial units.
- **Drives screen**: Removed hardcoded imperial unit conversions on max speed, distance chart, and top speed chart (values already pre-converted by API).
- **Spelling**: Minor spelling and translation corrections.

## [1.4.0-beta2] - 2026-04-04

### Added
- **Sentry event heatmap**: 6-day activity heatmap (12x6 grid, 2-hour blocks) at the top of the Sentry History screen. Color intensity from palette empty to red indicates event density (0–20+ events). Tapping a cell shows a tooltip with date, time range, and event count; tapping the tooltip scrolls to matching alerts. Future hours are transparent.
- **Sentry alert addresses**: Alert rows now show the TeslaMate geofence name or reverse-geocoded address instead of repeating "Alert detected". Coordinates are captured at detection time; addresses are resolved lazily from the geocode cache or Nominatim.

### Fixed
- **Sentry History theme**: Screen now follows the system light/dark theme instead of being always dark.

## [1.4.0-beta1] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- **Trip grouping**: Automatically detects highway/road trips (drives connected by DC charging stops) and groups them into unified trips. Dedicated Trips screen with list and detail view including route map, country flags, summary stats, and per-leg breakdown.
- **Sentry alert history**: Persistent on-device log of sentry alert events. Tap the red sentry dot on the dashboard or widget to view current session alerts and past alerts grouped by day. Sentry notifications also deep-link to the history screen.
- **Widget charging power**: Home screen widget now shows charging power in the status bar icons.
- **Mileage screen**: Added energy cost, total energy consumption, and average efficiency (Wh/km) to all levels (lifetime, year, month, day).
- **Charges screen**: "Select all / Deselect all" toggle in the location filter dropdown, respects the current search query.

### Changed

- **Weather Along the Way**: Fixed missing °C→°F conversion for Open-Meteo weather data when using imperial units.
- **Drives screen**: Removed hardcoded imperial unit conversions on max speed, distance chart, and top speed chart (values already pre-converted by API).
- **Spelling**: Minor spelling and translation corrections.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- **Where was I that day?**: New feature on the dashboard to look up the car's position and activity at any past date and time. Shows map, location breadcrumb (country/region/city), car state (driving/charging/parked), state-specific details, and weather. Tapping a card navigates to the corresponding detail screen. When the car was parked/sleeping all day, it finds the last known location and shows how long the car has been parked with a "since" timestamp.
- **Line chart visual revamp**: Smooth cubic Bezier curves, gradient fills, dashed grid lines, vertical crosshair, glowing indicators, animated entrance, and theme-aware tooltips.
- **Battery heater overlay**: Grafana-style orange annotation bands on drive detail Power and Battery charts highlighting battery pre-heating periods.
- **Speed distribution histogram**: Drive details now include a speed histogram showing the percentage of time spent in each speed bucket (10 km/h or 5 mph).
- **Chinese language support**: Added Simplified Chinese (简体中文) as the 5th supported language.

### Changed
- **Map markers**: Replaced default OSMDroid markers with custom pin-needle markers (accent-colored circle head with thin needle) across all map screens (dashboard, Where was I?, charge details).
- **HTTP requests**: All HTTP requests now include a `MateDroid/<version>` User-Agent header.

## [1.2.3] - 2026-03-08

### Added
- **Notifications**: One-time permission dialog at startup explaining notification features (sentry events, tyre pressure, charging status) before requesting Android 13+ POST_NOTIFICATIONS permission

### Fixed
- **Home screen widget**: Fixed aspect-ratio distortion on Nova Launcher and other third-party launchers that report widget dimensions inconsistently. Status bar icons and temperatures are now rendered as Glance composables instead of being drawn into the background bitmap.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed
- **Units system-wide**: All screens and the home screen widget now correctly respect the unit system configured in TeslamateAPI (metric vs imperial). Distances, speeds, efficiency, and temperatures are now consistently formatted across Drives, Stats, Mileage, Battery, Countries Visited, Regions Visited screens, and the widget range display (#176)
- **Home screen widget**: Location text (geofence name or address) no longer shifts upward when the car is charging. When idle, it stays right-aligned on the same line as the SoC percentage; when charging, it shares the bottom row with the charging details

## [1.2.1] - 2026-03-07

### Added
- **Home screen widget**: On 2×2 and 3×2 sizes, the widget now shows the car's current location (geofence name, or reverse-geocoded address, or raw coordinates as fallback) in the lower right corner. For privacy and security, this is intentionally shown only on the home screen — the lock screen widget retains its previous layout without location data.
- **Home screen widget**: Remaining range is now shown in the top center of 2×2 and 3×2 widgets, on the same line as the status icons, replacing the charge limit label (which is still visible as a zone on the battery bar).

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- **Sentry event detection**: Detects sentry mode alert events via polling when sentry mode is active. Fires a heads-up notification on a dedicated "Sentry Alerts" channel and shows a running event counter next to the sentry red dot on both the dashboard and the home screen widget. Counter resets when sentry mode turns off.
- **Home screen widget**: Battery info widget for the Android home screen. Shows battery level, range, state, temperature, and charging details (power, voltage, current, phases, energy added, time to full) for any configured car. Features a dimmed car image background with a static glow effect when charging. One widget per car can be configured; updates every 15 minutes via WorkManager.
- **Dashboard**: Swipe left/right on the car image to switch between vehicles when multiple cars are configured; dot indicators below the image show which car is selected

### Fixed
- **Home screen widget**: Tapping a widget now opens the app and selects the correct car instead of always showing the first car

## [1.2.0-beta1] - 2026-02-26

### Added
- **Sentry event detection**: Detects sentry mode alert events (center display state "6") via fast 10-second polling when sentry mode is active. Fires a heads-up notification on a dedicated "Sentry Alerts" channel and shows a running event counter next to the sentry red dot on both the dashboard and the home screen widget. Counter resets when sentry mode turns off.
- **Home screen widget**: Battery info widget for the Android home screen. Shows battery level, range, state, temperature, and charging details (power, voltage, current, phases, energy added, time to full) for any configured car. Features a dimmed car image background with a static glow effect when charging. One widget per car can be configured; updates every 15 minutes via WorkManager.
- **Dashboard**: Swipe left/right on the car image to switch between vehicles when multiple cars are configured; dot indicators below the image show which car is selected

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-20

### Changed
- **Live Charge Screen**: Current SoC is now the most prominent element — displayed as a large hero number at the top of the header card, with a 3-column start/current/target row and progress bar below. Energy and power stats are compacted into a single row.

### Fixed
- **Notifications**: Live charge navigation and notification deep-link are now hidden when TeslaMate API < 1.24 (endpoint unavailable)
